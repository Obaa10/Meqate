# Meqate - A Comprehensive Prayer Time App
Meqate is a simple and user-friendly application that helps Muslims to keep track of their daily prayer times. It uses the device's location to calculate the prayer times according to the user's city and country. The app also provides a feature to read and learn from Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad) on daily basis, which can enhance the spiritual experience of the user. The added offline feature allows the user to access prayer times and hadith even when they don't have internet connection making it a convenient app for travelers or for places where internet connection is poor. With Meqate, you can stay connected to your faith and maintain a regular prayer schedule offline without the need of language and calendar feature.

## Features
- Accurate prayer times based on device's location.
- Hadith feature that allows users to read and learn daily.
- Offline access to prayer times and hadith.
